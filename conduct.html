title: we-DELIVER - Code of Conduct

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

we-DELIVER is a research project that relies strongly on the efficient collaboration of the diverse community of people involved. Since not all participants are affiliated with the North-West University we have adopted a broader code of conduct  to help project members understand the values adhered to in this projec.

We value the involvement of everyone in our community - under- and postgraduate students, postdoctoral research fellows, researchers, support staff, rural community members, local government officials, service providers, funders, and other partners. We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing. All participants in our project, including communications related to the project, are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in the we-DELIVER project is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. This code of conduct applies to all spaces where we-DELIVER project members engage, including, meetings, workshops, community engagement activities, conferences, email communication, and online spaces. 

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct we ask that you report it to the project management by emailing <a href="mailto:vera.roos@nwu.ac.za?Subject=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Violation" target="_top">Prof Vera Roos</a>Prof Vera Roos or <a href="mailto:anelda.vanderwalt@nwu.ac.za?Subject=Code%20of%20Conduct%20Violation" target="_top">Anelda van der Walt</a>, and if the violation occurs during an in-person event, by contacting the host and/or coordinator. All reports will be kept confidential. 

<h2>Our Code of Conduct</h2>

The we-DELIVER team is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. However, we recognise that some groups in our community are subject to historical and ongoing discrimination, and may be vulnerable or disadvantaged. Membership in such a specific group can be on the basis of characteristics such as such as gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, sex, colour, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, citizenship, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, age, or choice of text editor. We do not tolerate harassment of participants on the basis of these categories, or for any other reason.

Harassment is any form of behaviour intended to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort. Because we are a diverse community, we may have different ways of communicating and of understanding the intent behind actions. Therefore we have chosen to prohibit certain forms of behaviour in our project community, regardless of intent. Prohibited harassing behaviour includes but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of a specific group listed above</li>
  <li>causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation
the display of sexual or violent images</li>
  <li>unwelcome sexual attention</li>
  <li>nonconsensual or unwelcome physical contact</li>
  <li>sustained disruption of talks, events or communications</li>
  <li>incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm</li>
  <li>continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop
publication of private communication without consent</li>
</ul>

Behaviour not explicitly mentioned above may still constitute harassment. The list above should not be taken as exhaustive but rather as a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the communities in which we participate. All we-DELIVER interactions should be professional regardless of location: harassment is prohibited whether it occurs on- or offline, and the same standards apply to both.

Enforcement of the Code of Conduct will be respectful and not include any harassing behaviors.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly project community for all.

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the one used by the Software Carpentry Foundation and is a modified version of that used by PyCon, which in turn is forked from a template written by the Ada Initiative and hosted on the Geek Feminism Wiki.
