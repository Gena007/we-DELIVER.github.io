Over the last few weeks several we-DELIVER members have been visiting the three campuses of the North-West University to recruit researchers and students from a variety of disciplines who are interested to collaborate on the project.  The North-West University consist of three geographically distributed campusses: Potchefstroom and Mafikeng campusses situated in the North-West province, and Vaal Triangle campus situated in Gauteng.

On 28 March we visited Vaal Triangle campus to meet with various stakeholders. In the photo above we're meeting with Prof Jaco Hoffman to discuss progress since our last engagement. From left to right: Prof Jaco Hoffman, Prof Vera Roos, Anelda van der Walt, and Dr Shingairai Chigeza. The we-DELIVER project forms part of the Age-friendly cities/Communities project under Jaco's Aging and Generational Dynamics (AGenDA) sub-programme in the [Optentia Research Focus Area](http://www.optentia.co.za/).

To date we have had interest from researchers and students in research areas such as social work, psychology, sports science, computer science, population studies, health science, law, sociology, digital humanities and more. It's turning out to be a truly transdisciplinary project and we're excited about what we will learn from each other as the project progresses.
