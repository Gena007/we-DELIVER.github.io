We recently heard that the we-DELIVER project will be funded in the 2016/2017 Tirelo Bosha funding cycle. More information about the original call is available at the <a href="http://www.dpsa.gov.za/tirelobosha/?q=node/22">Tirelo Bosha website</a>.  We are currently busy putting together the project team and submitting our ethics application after which the project will officially kick off. We'll be posting news about our progress here over the course of the project.
