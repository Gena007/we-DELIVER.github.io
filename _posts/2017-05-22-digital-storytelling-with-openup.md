### About OpenUp
OpenUp believes that an equal society starts with equal access to information, and that access to relevant information creates an active citizenry. You cannot change something if you don't know what it is, how it works, or that it even exists. This is why we are opening data. And then building tools to make the data available and understandable to society.

This workshop is organised by NWU Digital Humanities in collaboration with the [we-Deliver](http://we-deliver.github.io/)* project

* we-DELIVER is a project aimed at delivering better services to older people (>60 years) in rural communities in South Africa through the use of information and communication technologies (ICT).
