title: we-DELIVER - Project Resources
---

we-DELIVER will generate loads of useful resources. For this reason we created a [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) repository, where we will be making our digital resources available under [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses where possible. The following resources are now available:


<table>
  <tr> <th>Resource Name</th>               <th>Description</th>                                                                                <th>Link</th> </tr>
