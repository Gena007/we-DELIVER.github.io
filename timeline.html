<h1>we-DELIVER Project Timeline</h1>

<p>The we-DELIVER project has been funded for a total time of roughly 18 months. During this time various team members might be joining the project for only a specific phase or for a number of phases, sometimes with time elapsing where they may not be actively involved in the day-to-day activities. For this reason and also for stakeholders who are interested in the project but not part of the core project team, we are using a <a href="http://sutori.com/">Sutori Timeline</a> to tell the story of the project over time.
</p>

<p>The beauty of Sutori is that project members can contribute collaboratively to the content on the timeline. If you would like to contribute to the information displayed here, please get in touch with <a href="mailto:juan.steyn@nwu.ac.za">Juan Steyn</a>.
