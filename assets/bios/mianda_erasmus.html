<p>Mianda Erasmus is a lecturer in the Psychology Programme at the Mafikeng Campus of the North-West University. Mianda has completed several degrees in Music, French and Psychology, and lived abroad for some periods, which provided diverse experiences and enriched her for her current lecturing position. She started lecturing psychology full time in 2012 and has also been the coordinator for the undergraduate psychology programme at the Mafikeng Campus since 2013. She has a passion for teaching and learning, with a special interest in social and community psychology, aiming to develop her studentsâ€™ graduate attributes by giving them, as far as possible, exposure to real life situations, experts and research communities. </p>

<p>The we-DELIVER project allows her and the postgraduate students she supervises to be part of a multidisciplinary, cross-campus research project, while also making a difference in the community. Being very interested in technology as well, the ICT focus of the we-DELIVER project encouraged her to become part of it. </p>
