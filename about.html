<h1>About we-DELIVER</h1>
  
<p>The we-DELIVER project proposal was submitted to the 2015/2016 funding call of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Tirelo-Bosha-1152098614915805/">Tirelo Bosha</a> by colleagues from the <a href="http://www.nwu.ac.za">North-West University</a> under the leadership of <a href="http://veraroos.co.za/">Prof Vera Roos</a>.
</p>

<p>In January 2017 we were informed that the application was successful and that the project could commence officially in March 2017.
